# Management-of-multiple-companies
I've created this OOP project to manage multiple companies in a directory from company details to employees details.

In this project I used STLs, templates, inheritance, virtual functions and data, dynamic cast and multiple basic OOP ideas.

The project intends to manage multiple companies. It has the purpose to save data about company details, company's departments and also the employees from each department. Regarding the employees I took in consideration allocation a single manager from a group of managers to each employee. I have created an interface, menu that is supposed to control the program and it's applications. I've added basic functions that show, add and modify the directory, in each class. On top of that, I've created functions that presents all the managers in the company and also their employees. I've created multiple utily functions such as displaying the number of employees per department/company, the cost of all the salaries in the company, departments with more than a number of employees. I've created the posibility to combine 2 companies into one, in the case of a company having the same department, the department will unify into one transfering all the employees and the managers keeping their status of manager. I also made sure so that you won't be able to add the same company multiple times. Lastly I created a template to work for any kind of company.
